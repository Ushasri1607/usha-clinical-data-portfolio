## EHR SQL Analysis

### Objective
To analyze electronic health record (EHR)-style relational data using SQL in order to identify patient encounter trends, diagnosis distributions, and visit patterns that support clinical and operational decision-making.

---

### Dataset
- Simulated EHR dataset
- Tables include patients, encounters, and diagnoses
- Represents outpatient and inpatient visit data

---

### Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- Relational database concepts
- Healthcare data modeling

---

### What I Did
- Queried patient encounter data using SQL joins
- Analyzed encounter class distribution (outpatient vs inpatient)
- Identified common diagnoses across encounters
- Performed aggregations and filtering to extract insights

---

### Key Insights
- Majority of encounters were outpatient visits
- Chronic conditions appeared frequently across multiple encounters
- Encounter patterns highlighted repeat visits for specific diagnoses
